        <ul>
            <li>NumPy: A powerful library for scientific computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It also offers a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.</li>
            <li>Pandas: A data manipulation library that provides data structures like DataFrames for easy handling and analysis of structured data. It also offers tools for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.</li>
            <li>Matplotlib: A plotting library that allows you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It provides a wide range of plotting options, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.</li>
            <li>SciPy: A library that builds on top of NumPy, offering additional scientific algorithms and functions. It includes modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, signal and image processing, and more.</li>
            <li>Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library that provides a wide range of algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It also offers tools for model selection, evaluation, and preprocessing.</li>
