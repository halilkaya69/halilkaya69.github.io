            Correlation is used in many fields. Businesses can use correlation analysis to evaluate the impact of marketing strategies or examine the relationship between customer satisfaction and sales figures. It also has great importance in disciplines such as economics, sociology and psychology. Statistical correlation analysis allows researchers to interpret results and predict future trends by identifying relationships between variables.

            Correlation can be measured by various methods. Pearson correlation coefficient is the most commonly used method. This coefficient indicates the strength (between -1 and +1) and direction (negative, positive, or nonlinear) of the relationship between variables. Other correlation measures include rank-based methods such as Spearman and Kendall.
